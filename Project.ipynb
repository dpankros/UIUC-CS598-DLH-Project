    "# Preface\n",
    "Much effort went into making the [original paper repository](https://github.com/healthylaife/Pediatric-Apnea-Detection) runnable.  The repository was lacking any documentation including even python version and package versions.  It was built exclusively to be run on Windows and lacked any attempt at cross-platform support.  We ran into several cases where the code, as supplied, could never have been run in the provided state.  In one instance, for example, the arguments to a function were illegal and, after reaching out to the author and receiving no reply, we used our best judgment at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we are attempting to reproduce results consistent with the original paper, but there may be differences due to these changes or other instances of errors or omissions that did not cause a code failure and that may have been too subtle to be caught in our initial passes over the code.  These differences will, inevitably, cause deviations between our results and the results presented in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have, however, undertaken in [our fork of the original code](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/tree/main/original) to provide more information to aid reproducibility (including a `requirements.txt` file and other detailed dependency information), made the code cross-platform where it was not, and provide for information about how to preprocess and run the code using standard tools like bash and make.\n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep apnea in children is a major health problem that affects between one to five percent of US children, but differs from sleep apnea in adults in its clinical causes and characteristics.  Thus, previously-created methods for detecting adult sleep apnea may be ineffective at detecting pediatric sleep apnea.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "While there are numerous testing tools and algorithmic methods for detecting adult sleep apnea, the same tools and methods are unavailable for pediatric sleep apnea (PSA) due to these differences. Detecting pediatric sleep apnea more quickly and easily can lead to earlier clinical intervention in the child's care and ultimately prevent the wide variety of health issues commonly caused by OSA.  Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard method for formal sleep apnea diagnosis, but is generally performed in a dedicated facility where a patient can be monitored overnight. Polysomnography involves collecting various continuous-time signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP), nasal airflow, and oral airflow.  While effective, PSG is, however, complex, costly and requires a dedicated sleep lab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### State of the Art\n",
    "Current methods target adults and, for reasons stated earlier, are ineffective at diagnosing PSA in childen. Very little work has been done in the scope of pediatric sleep apnea. In general, full Polysomnography data is hard to find and thus, much research has focused on determining the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) from ECG and SpO2 signals.   \n",
    "\n",
    "While transformers are used commonly in general deep learning models, they are much less prevalent in the detection of sleep apnea.  Two studies described in this paper used transformers to determine sleep stages (one in adults, one in children), while another used a hybrid CNN/transformer model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper\n",
    "The paper proposes to study the gaps in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) in children vis-a-vis adults. The paper then suggests a custom transformer-based method and data representation for PSA detection, and identifies the polysomography modalities that most closely correlate to OSAHS in children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results presented in the paper portray state-of-the-art results. \n",
    "![Figure 2](./images/figure_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If diagnosing pediatric sleep apnea can be done with low-cost, consumer hardware, then the costs of pediatric sleep apena diagnosis decrease and children's health improves.  Additionally, lowering the cost of dianoses would also enable access for underserved, including rural, populations with limited access to sleep labs."

    "# Scope of Reproducibility\n",
    "We will generally investigate whether we can beat state-of-the-art results from Polysomnography (PSG) studies in pediatric sleep apnea detection using the transformer-based model proposed in the paper and discussed above. More specifically, we will focus on testing the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whether the proposed model can achieve results from signals more easily collected than PSG. As in the paper, we will focus on ECG and $SpO_2$ signals, and\n",
    "2. Whether the results support this method being effective as a dedicated method for in-lab sleep studies.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we detail how we acquire, process and load the relevant data, and how we train and evaluate the model given those data.  We will exlain the procedure and code in this notebook with the understanding that we did not process the data, train the model, or evaluate the model using this notebook.  True reproduction of our environment is explained in the Repository Setup and Evaluation section, immediately following.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Repository Setup and Evalution\n",
    "\n",
    "We undertook to make this repository as complete and easily setup as possible. Much of these instructions are listed in the Readme.md in [our repository](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-project).  This assumes that the environment variable DATA_ROOT has been set and at least part of the raw  NCH dataset has been downloaded to `$DATA_ROOT`. \n",
    "1. Clone the repository from `https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-project`.  E.g. `git clone https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-project`\n",
    "2. Change to the code directory: `cd original`\n",
    "3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  (of course, if using conda, poetry, venv or other virtual environment there may be additional steps or a different procedure here)\n",
    "4. Run: `make train`.  If a different number of EPOCHS for training is desired or if the data directory should be changed, the following command can be used, `DLHPROJ_NUM_EPOCHS=200 DATA_ROOT=/a_new_data_dir make train`\n",
