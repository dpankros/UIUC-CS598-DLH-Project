It only considers the general type of research in our paper pool. Feel free to edit it to better fit your project. You will iteratively update the same notebook submission for your draft and the final submission. Please check the project rubriks to get a sense of what is expected in the template.\n","\n","---\n","\n","# FAQ and Attentions\n","* Copy and move this template to your Google Drive. Name your notebook by your team ID (upper-left corner). Don't eidt this original file.\n","* This template covers most questions we want to ask about your reproduction experiment. You don't need to exactly follow the template, however, you should address the questions. Please feel free to customize your report accordingly.\n","* any report must have run-able codes and necessary annotations (in text and code comments).\n","* The notebook is like a demo and only uses small-size data (a subset of original data or processed data), the entire runtime of the notebook including data reading, data process, model training, printing, figure plotting, etc,\n","must be within 8 min, otherwise, you may get penalty on the grade.\n","  * If the raw dataset is too large to be loaded  you can select a subset of data and pre-process the data, then, upload the subset or processed data to Google Drive and load them in this notebook.\n","  * If the whole training is too long to run, you can only set the number of training epoch to a small number, e.g., 3, just show that the training is runable.\n","  * For results model validation, you can train the model outside this notebook in advance, then, load pretrained model and use it for validation (display the figures, print the metrics).\n","* The post-process is important! For post-process of the results,please use plots/figures. The code to summarize results and plot figures may be tedious, however, it won't be waste of time since these figures can be used for presentation. While plotting in code, the figures should have titles or captions if necessary (e.g., title your figure with \"Figure 1. xxxx\")\n","* There is not page limit to your notebook report, you can also use separate notebooks for the report, just make sure your grader can access and run/test them.\n","* If you use outside resources, please refer them (in any formats).
