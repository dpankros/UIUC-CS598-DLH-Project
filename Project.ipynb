    "* This template covers most questions we want to ask about your reproduction experiment. You don't need to exactly follow the template, however, you should address the questions. Please feel free to customize your report accordingly.\n",

    "  * If the whole training is too long to run, you can only set the number of training epoch to a small number, e.g., 3, just show that the training is runable.\n",

    "* The post-process is important! For post-process of the results,please use plots/figures. The code to summarize results and plot figures may be tedious, however, it won't be waste of time since these figures can be used for presentation. While plotting in code, the figures should have titles or captions if necessary (e.g., title your figure with \"Figure 1. xxxx\")\n",

    "Much effort went into making the [original repository](https://github.com/healthylaife/Pediatric-Apnea-Detection) runnable.

We ran into several cases where the code, as supplied, could never have been run in the provided state.  In one instance, for example, the arguments to a function were illegal and, after reaching out to the author and receiving no reply, we used our best judgment at a solution.\n",

These differences will, inevitably, cause deviations between our results and the results presented in the paper.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "Sleep apnea in children is a major health problem that affects between one to five percent of US children, but differs from sleep apnea in adults in its clinical causes and characteristics.  Thus, previously-created methods for detecting adult sleep apnea may be ineffective at detecting pediatric sleep apnea.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are numerous testing tools and algorithmic methods for detecting adult sleep apnea, the same tools and methods are unavailable for pediatric sleep apnea (PSA) due to these differences. Detecting pediatric sleep apnea more easily can lead to earlier clinical intervention in the child's care and ultimately ____(need to ask Julie about effects of PSA)___.  Polysomnography is the standard method for formal sleep apnea diagnosis, but is generally performed in a dedicated facility where a patient can be monitored overnight. Polysomnography involves collecting various continuous-time signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP), nasal airflow, and oral airflow.  While effective, Polysomnography is, however, complex, costly and requires a dedicated sleep lab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### State of the Art\n",
    "Current methods target adults and, for reasons stated earlier, are ineffective at diagnosing PSA. Very little work has been done in the scope of pediatric sleep apnea.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, full Polysomnography data is hard to find and thus, much research has focused on determining the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) from ECG and SpO2 signals.   \n",
    "\n",
    "While transformers are used commonly in general deep learning models, they are less prevalent in the detection of sleep apnea.  Two studies used transformers to determine sleep stages (one in adults, one in children), while another used a hybrid CNN/transformer model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper\n",
    "The paper proposes to study the gaps in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) in children vis-a-vis adults. The paper then suggests a custom transformer-based method and data representation for PSA detection, and identifies the polysomography modalities that most closely correlate to OSAHS in children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results presented in the paper portray state-of-the-art results. \n",
    "![Figure 2](./images/figure_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If diagnosis of pediatric sleep apnea can be performed with low-cost, consumer hardware, then costs of pediatric sleep apena diagnosis decrease and chilren's health improves.  Additionally, this also enables access for underserved, including rural, populations with limited access to sleep labs.\n"
