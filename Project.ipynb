    "# Preface\n",
    "Much effort went into making the [original paper repository](https://github.com/healthylaife/Pediatric-Apnea-Detection) runnable.  The repository was lacking any documentation including even python version and package versions.  It was built exclusively to be run on Windows and lacked any attempt at cross-platform support.  We ran into several cases where the code, as supplied, could never have been run in the provided state.  In one instance, for example, the arguments to a function were illegal and, after reaching out to the author and receiving no reply, we used our best judgment at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we are attempting to reproduce results consistent with the original paper, but there may be differences due to these changes or other instances of errors or omissions that did not cause a code failure and that may have been too subtle to be caught in our initial passes over the code.  These differences will, inevitably, cause deviations between our results and the results presented in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have, however, undertaken in [our fork of the original code](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/tree/main/original) to provide more information to aid reproducibility (including a `requirements.txt` file and other detailed dependency information), made the code cross-platform where it was not, and provide for information about how to preprocess and run the code using standard tools like bash and make.\n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep apnea in children is a major health problem that affects between one to five percent of US children, but differs from sleep apnea in adults in its clinical causes and characteristics.  Thus, previously-created methods for detecting adult sleep apnea may be ineffective at detecting pediatric sleep apnea.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "While there are numerous testing tools and algorithmic methods for detecting adult sleep apnea, the same tools and methods are unavailable for pediatric sleep apnea (PSA) due to these differences. Detecting pediatric sleep apnea more quickly and easily can lead to earlier clinical intervention in the child's care and ultimately prevent the wide variety of health issues commonly caused by Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).  These effects depend on the underlying cause of the OSA, but can include poor attention span, hyperactivity, poor school performance, craniofacial development abnormalities, narrow palate, dentition issues, increased risk of cavities, cognitive deficits, poor quality of life, elevated blood pressure, elevated inflammatory markers, to name a few. $^{2,3}$  This list does not include the secondary effects of misdiagnosis of PSA and the medication-induced side effects caused by its misdiagnosis, which is unfortunately common.  It is, therefore, extremely important to identify and provide early intervention to treat Pediatric OSA before the worst of these symptoms occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard method for formal sleep apnea diagnosis, but is generally performed in a dedicated facility where a patient can be monitored overnight. Polysomnography involves collecting various continuous-time signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP), nasal airflow, and oral airflow.  While effective, PSG is, however, complex, costly and requires a dedicated sleep lab.  That a sleep lab is required makes OSA in children inaccessible to under-served areas and economically disadvantaged populations.  If OSA can be detected earlier and with inexpensive and commonly-available equipment the most-severe impacts can be lessened leading to better outcomes and a lower cost to the healthcare system generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State of the Art\n",
    "Current methods target adults and, for reasons stated earlier, are ineffective at diagnosing PSA in children. Very little work has been done in the scope of pediatric sleep apnea (PSA). In general, full Polysomnography data is hard to find and thus, much research has focused on determining the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) from ECG and SpO2 signals.   \n",
    "\n",
    "While transformers are used commonly in general deep learning models, they are much less prevalent in the detection of sleep apnea.  Two studies described in this paper used transformers to determine sleep stages (one in adults, one in children), while another used a hybrid CNN/transformer model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper\n",
    "The paper proposes to study the gaps in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) in children vis-a-vis adults. The paper then suggests a custom transformer-based method and data representation for PSA detection, and identifies the polysomography modalities that most closely correlate to OSAHS in children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results presented in the paper portray state-of-the-art results. \n",

    "# Scope of Reproducibility\n",
    "We will generally investigate whether we can beat state-of-the-art results from Polysomnography (PSG) studies in pediatric sleep apnea detection using the transformer-based model proposed in the paper and discussed above. More specifically, we will focus on testing the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whether the proposed model can achieve results from signals more easily collected than PSG. As in the paper, we will focus on ECG and $SpO_2$ signals, and\n",
    "2. Whether the results support this method being effective as a dedicated method for in-lab sleep studies.\n"

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we detail how we acquire, process and load the relevant data, and how we train and evaluate the model given those data.  We will exlain the procedure and code in this notebook with the understanding that we did not process the data, train the model, or evaluate the model using this notebook.  True reproduction of our environment is explained in the Repository Setup and Evaluation section, immediately following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "The original project lacked any definition of python and dependency version requirements.  We documented the complete list of python packages and versions necessary to run our repository in our [environment.yaml file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/main/environment.yml).  For convenience, the primary requirements we chose were:\n",
    "- python 3.11\n",
    "- tensorflow 2.15\n",
    "- keras 2.16\n",
    "- numpy 1.26\n",
    "- pandas 2.2\n",
    "- scipy 1.12\n",
    "\n",
    "# Repository Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We originally started with the [original research code](https://github.com/healthylaife/Pediatric-Apnea-Detection), copied it into this project's [repository](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project), and began making changes. As detailed elsewhere, much work was done to get the code to a runnable state, then more was done to make it performant, able to load models from checkpoints, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we got to a good state in the repository, we moved code into this notebook and modified it as necessary to work in this environment. Some of those modifications include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intra-project imports don't work so we had to remove them and linearize the intra-project dependency graph herein\n",
    "- Everything is in a global namespace, so we had to fix the naming conflicts that arose herein\n",
    "- Testing and training code is combined in the repository, but it made more sense to split the two pieces herein, so we had to extract large segments of code common to both operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the differences between code in this notebook and code in the repository, we achieve the same result in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to run the code in the repository, please see the [`original/HOW_TO_RUN.md` file](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/blob/main/original/HOW_TO_RUN.md)"

Each of these datasets are collected from actual sleep studies, anonymized and made available for research.  We were granted access to the CHAT dataset very late in timeline of this project.  We considered incorporating it into our code, but the lateness coupled with the state of the code in other sections implied a high of risk that we were not able to align with the project timeline.

Similarly, in the GPU-enabled setups above, all the GPU-dedicated RAM was used during model training.\n",

The total combined training and testing time per model, including data loading and model saving was approximately 14 minutes.

    ">Code to generate this the the below data visualizations is elided from this notebook for clarity and brevity purposes, and can be found in our repository at [`original/eval/plot.py`](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/blob/main/original/eval/plot.py). We have provided rendered graph images instead.\n",

    "In this figure, our results are shown in shades of orange with the original paper's results shown in shades of blue.\n",

    "The original paper's results are more consistent across the various combinations of signals, and while the mean F1 score and the mean AUROC score are close, our results differ more substantially in the standard deviation of each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key differences account for the differences in the final calculated statistics.  Chiefly among these, the size of the data set used for training differed substantially.  The original paper used the entire NCH dataset, but due to bandwidth limitations on [physionet.org](https://physionet.org) (the repository for these data), we were only able to use a roughly 500GB subset of the data (around 25%), which was selected by the first files the `wget` command (the tool used to download these data) fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we do not truly know if this was a random sample, a chronological sample, or if our dataset was skewed by some underlying sampling bias inadvertently introduced by the wget command.  The quality of the results overall seems to suggest it was random, but without much more analysis of the included data against the broader dataset, that question remains open.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is logical to conclude that a larger overall training set would make each fold proportionally larger and, thus, lead to more consistent results across each combination of folds and, in turn, lead to a smaller standard deviation for F1 and AUROC scores.  Thus, we conclude the majority of the difference between the original paper's results and our results is in the dataset size used for training."

The remaining signals demonstrate correlation with *lower* scores.  AUROC scores follow the same pattern with slightly different correlation coefficients.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see that the results of the SPO2 correlation are definitely non-random based on the p-score in that case of 0 for both F1 and AUROC.  CO2 is definitely non-random for AUROC and for F1 it slightly exceeds the standard significantly-significant threshold of 0.05.  CO2 is likely non-random due to the low p-value, despite that it does not meet the commonly accepted threshold.  The other signals cannot disprove the null-hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we can see that the original paper's selection of SPO2 and ECG captured the two largest contributors to high-scores.  Our results showed that a combination of ECG, EEG, and SPO2 yielded the best results for F1 scores (81.88), but based on the p-value of the EEG signal for F1 scores (0.98), we refrain from assuming that this is would be true if trained on the entire NCH dataset due to the high likelihood that the EEG contribution is random."

Below are the highest-impact tasks we would suggest the authors complete to improve their code and overall open-source repository for future contributors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add clear documentation to each public Python function, including descriptions of parameters and return values\n",
    "- Add [Python type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) to at least the function parameters and return values of public functions\n",
    "- Add complete information about the expected runtime environment, including required Python version(s) and dependency versions (including transitive dependencies)\n",
    "    - We used [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) to manage this information and would suggest the authors use this system as well, if they don't already have a preferred system.\n",
    "- Do an audit to ensure that model architecture and evaluations match those described in the paper\n",
    "- Update their repository with changes as modifications are made during ongoing research\n",
    "- Add at least minimal testing to ensure all code runs successfully. Ideas for tests include:\n",
    "    - Construct the model, load it from pretrained weights, and do several inferences. Use this test to ensure the model runs with some minimal quality bar\n",
    "    - Train the model for a small number of epochs to make sure loss is established and gradient descent/backpropagation works properly and loss begins decreasing\n",
    "    - Preprocess and load one sleep study to ensure preprocessing/data loading code runs properly"
