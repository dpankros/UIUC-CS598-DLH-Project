    "# Preface\n",
    "Much effort went into making the [original paper repository](https://github.com/healthylaife/Pediatric-Apnea-Detection) runnable.  The repository was lacking any documentation including even python version and package versions.  It was built exclusively to be run on Windows and lacked any attempt at cross-platform support.  We ran into several cases where the code, as supplied, could never have been run in the provided state.  In one instance, for example, the arguments to a function were illegal and, after reaching out to the author and receiving no reply, we used our best judgment at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we are attempting to reproduce results consistent with the original paper, but there may be differences due to these changes or other instances of errors or omissions that did not cause a code failure and that may have been too subtle to be caught in our initial passes over the code.  These differences will, inevitably, cause deviations between our results and the results presented in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have, however, undertaken in [our fork of the original code](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/tree/main/original) to provide more information to aid reproducibility (including a `requirements.txt` file and other detailed dependency information), made the code cross-platform where it was not, and provide for information about how to preprocess and run the code using standard tools like bash and make.\n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep apnea in children is a major health problem that affects between one to five percent of US children, but differs from sleep apnea in adults in its clinical causes and characteristics.  Thus, previously-created methods for detecting adult sleep apnea may be ineffective at detecting pediatric sleep apnea.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "While there are numerous testing tools and algorithmic methods for detecting adult sleep apnea, the same tools and methods are unavailable for pediatric sleep apnea (PSA) due to these differences. Detecting pediatric sleep apnea more quickly and easily can lead to earlier clinical intervention in the child's care and ultimately prevent the wide variety of health issues commonly caused by Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).  Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard method for formal sleep apnea diagnosis, but is generally performed in a dedicated facility where a patient can be monitored overnight. Polysomnography involves collecting various continuous-time signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP), nasal airflow, and oral airflow.  While effective, PSG is, however, complex, costly and requires a dedicated sleep lab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### State of the Art\n",
    "Current methods target adults and, for reasons stated earlier, are ineffective at diagnosing PSA in childen. Very little work has been done in the scope of pediatric sleep apnea. In general, full Polysomnography data is hard to find and thus, much research has focused on determining the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) from ECG and SpO2 signals.   \n",
    "\n",
    "While transformers are used commonly in general deep learning models, they are much less prevalent in the detection of sleep apnea.  Two studies described in this paper used transformers to determine sleep stages (one in adults, one in children), while another used a hybrid CNN/transformer model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper\n",
    "The paper proposes to study the gaps in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) in children vis-a-vis adults. The paper then suggests a custom transformer-based method and data representation for PSA detection, and identifies the polysomography modalities that most closely correlate to OSAHS in children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results presented in the paper portray state-of-the-art results. \n",
    "![Figure 2](./images/figure_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If diagnosing pediatric sleep apnea can be done with low-cost, consumer hardware, then the costs of pediatric sleep apena diagnoses decrease and childrens' health improves.  Additionally, lowering the cost of dianoses would also enable access for underserved, including rural, populations with limited access to sleep labs."

    "# Scope of Reproducibility\n",
    "We will generally investigate whether we can beat state-of-the-art results from Polysomnography (PSG) studies in pediatric sleep apnea detection using the transformer-based model proposed in the paper and discussed above. More specifically, we will focus on testing the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whether the proposed model can achieve results from signals more easily collected than PSG. As in the paper, we will focus on ECG and $SpO_2$ signals, and\n",
    "2. Whether the results support this method being effective as a dedicated method for in-lab sleep studies.\n"

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we detail how we acquire, process and load the relevant data, and how we train and evaluate the model given those data.  We will exlain the procedure and code in this notebook with the understanding that we did not process the data, train the model, or evaluate the model using this notebook.  True reproduction of our environment is explained in the Repository Setup and Evaluation section, immediately following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "The original project lacked any definition of python and dependency version requirements.  We documented the complete list of python packages and versions necessary to run our repository in our [environment.yaml file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/main/environment.yml).  For convenience, the primary requirements we chose were:\n",
    "- python 3.11\n",
    "- tensorflow 2.15\n",
    "- keras 2.16\n",
    "- numpy 1.26\n",
    "- pandas 2.2\n",
    "- scipy 1.12\n",
    "\n",
    "# Repository Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We originally started with the [original research code](https://github.com/healthylaife/Pediatric-Apnea-Detection), copied it into this project's [repository](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project), and began making changes. As detailed elsewhere, much work was done to get the code to a runnable state, then more was done to make it performant, able to load models from checkpoints, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we got to a good state in the repository, we moved code into this notebook and modified it as necessary to work in this environment. Some of those modifications include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intra-project imports don't work so we had to remove them and linearize the intra-project dependency graph herein\n",
    "- Everything is in a global namespace, so we had to fix the naming conflicts that arose herein\n",
    "- Testing and training code is combined in the repository, but it made more sense to split the two pieces herein, so we had to extract large segments of code common to both operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the differences between code in this notebook and code in the repository, we achieve the same result in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to run the code in the repository, please see the [`original/HOW_TO_RUN.md` file](https://github.com/arschles/UIUC-CS598-DLH-Project/blob/main/original/HOW_TO_RUN.md)"

While this architecture has led to excellent results in NLP and other applications, it has, to our knowledge, not been studied in the context of sleep apnea. It is implemented (although broken, as we discuss elsewhere in this notebook) in the paper's [accompanying open-source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/healthylaife/Pediatric-Apnea-Detection).\n",

    "![model architecture](./images/model_arch.png)\n",

    "As seen in this architecture, inputs, which are primarily pre-processed signals data, are first fed in parallel through a variety of 1-D convolutional layers, partially concatenated to fewer parallel \"tracks\", and then those results are passed through an activation layer. Next, all tracks are concatenated prior to being passed into the transformer, which includes at least one multi-headed attention mechanism and one dense layer. Finally, the output of the transformer is passed through a normalization layer, pooling layer, fully-connected layer (labeled \"Multi-layer perceptron\" in the illustration) and a final activation function.\n",

Thus, while the *maximum* epochs were 200, the *actual* epochs used to train a model were typically around 70.\n",

    "The starting learning rate is `0.0010`, and learning rates on an after epoch 52 were reduced using a Keras [`LearningRateScheduler`](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/learning_rate_scheduler/).  At epoch 52 and every 5 epochs thereafter, the learning rate is halved.  Thus, the learning rate schedule looks like the following after the first 3 adjustments:\n",

Similarly, in the GPU-enabled setups above, all the GPU-dedicated RAM was used during model training.\n",

The total combined training and testing time per model, including data loading and model saving was approximately 14 minutes.  For the total 63 ablations computed that equates to approximately 882 minutes or 14.7 hours of total compute time, most of which was nearly 100% GPU-bound.\n",

    "In the DigitalOcean setup described above, training and testing took significantly longer, and in the Paperspace setup, it took moderately longer, although we did not do an apples-to-apples comparison. Further, since the latter two configurations were cloud-based systems, we're unable to guarantee exclusive access to the underlying hardware and thus unable to guarantee a stable experiment in those cases."

    "Some key differences account for the differences in the final calculated statistics, however.  Chiefly among these, the size of the data set used for training differed substantially.  The original paper used the entire NCH dataset, but due to bandwidth limitations on [physionet.org](https://physionet.org) (the repository for these data), we were only able to use a roughly 500GB subset of the data, which was selected by the first files the `wget` command (the tool used to download these data) fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we do not truly know if this was a random sample, a chronological sample, or if our dataset was skewed by some underlying sampling bias inadvertently introduced by the wget command.  The quality of the results overall seems to suggest it was random, but without much more analysis of the included data against the broader dataset, that question remains open.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is logical to conclude that a larger overall training set would make each fold proportionally larger and, thus, lead to more consistent results across each combination of folds and, in turn, lead to a smaller standard deviation for F1 and AUROC scores."

The remaining signals demonstrate correlation with *lower* scores.  AUROC scores follow the same pattern with slightly different correlation coefficients.    \n",

    "We can also see that the results of the SPO2 correlation are definitely non-random based on the p-score in that case of 0 for both F1 and AUROC.  CO2 is definitely non-random for AUROC and for F1 it slightly exceeds the standard significantly-significant threshold of 0.05.  CO2 is likely non-random due to the low p-value, despite that it does not meet the commonly accepted threshold.  The other signals cannot disprove the null-hypothesis.\n",

    "Overall, we can see that the original paper's selection of SPO2 and ECG captured the two largest contributors to high-scores.  Our results showed that a combination of ECG, EEG, and SPO2 yielded the best results for F1 scores (81.88), but based on the p-value of the EEG signal for F1 scores (0.98), we refrain from assuming that this is would be true if trained on the entire NCH dataset due to the high likelihood that the EEG contribution is random."

    "- Add clear documentation to each public Python function, including descriptions of parameters and return values\n",

    "- Add at least minimal testing to ensure all code runs successfully. Ideas for tests include:\n",
    "    - Construct the model, load it from pretrained weights, and do several inferences. Use this test to ensure the model runs with some minimal quality bar\n",
    "    - Train the model for a small number of epochs to make sure loss is established and gradient descent/backpropagation works properly and loss begins decreasing\n",
