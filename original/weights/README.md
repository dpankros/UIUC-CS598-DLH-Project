# Pre-trained model weights

This directory contains a checkpoint of model weights saved after training the model on the full dataset to which we have access.

The name of the directories follows the pattern `<model type>_<signals>_<epochs>`.  Thus, a directory named `Transformer_CO2ECG_25` is a Transformer model with CO2 and ECG signals that was trained for 25 epochs.
